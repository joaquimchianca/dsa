# Data Structures Implementation

## This repo is study-purpose

## Compilation and execution
Clone this repo and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Inside every data structure folder there is a `main.ts` source code. You can:
1. Run `ts-node`
```bash
npx ts-node main.ts
```
2. Or convert Typescript to Javascript and then execute the JS file (vintage tho)
```bash
tsc main.ts
node main.js
```

## Testing
For tests, just use the implemented methods for each data structure above the implementation. See Linked List source file
for an example.
